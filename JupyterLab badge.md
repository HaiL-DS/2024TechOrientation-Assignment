## 1. Solve Problems 1,2,3 from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
**Problem 1.** If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. <br>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```python
sum = 0
for i in range(1000):
    if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0:
        sum += i
    i +=1

sum
```
**The result is:** &nbsp;&nbsp; `233168`


**Problem 2.** Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```python
Fibo = [1, 2]
sum = 0
while Fibo[-1] <= 4000000:
    Fibo.append(Fibo[-1]+Fibo[-2])

for i in Fibo[:-1]:
    if i%2 == 0:
        sum += i
sum
```
**The result is:** &nbsp;&nbsp; `4613732`


**Problem 3.** The prime factors of $13195$ are $5, 7, 13$ and $29$.
What is the largest prime factor of the number $600851475143$?

```python
import math
def IsPrime(x):
    for i in range(2, x):
        if x%i == 0:
            return False
            break
    return True

def MaxPrimFact(x):
    for i in range(int(math.sqrt(x))+1, 1, -1):
        if x%i == 0 and IsPrime(i):
            print(i)
            break

MaxPrimFact(600851475143)
```
**The result is:** &nbsp;&nbsp; `6857`

## 2. Use a random number generator to make histograms of popular probability distributions. Use the numpy and matplotlib packages. Choose THREE from the list below and store your resulting code in your github repo.
 * Binomial
 * Poisson
 * Normal
 * Uniform
 * Chi Squared

&nbsp;&nbsp; * Generating 1000 random numbers from a standard normmal distribution:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
collection = np.random.normal(loc = 0, scale = 1, size = 1000)  # python uses `loc` as `mean` and `scale` as `standard deviation`
plt.hist(collection, bins = 50)
plt.show()
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; * Generating 1000 random numbers from a binomial distribution with 10 number of trials and 25% probability of success:
```python
collection2 = np.random.binomial(100, 0.25, 1000)
plt.hist(collection2)
plt.show()
```

## 3. Visually Demonstrate (use histograms) to show that the Binomial and Normal distributions converge in the large *N* limit. Store the resulting histograms in your github repo. Make a mini-presentation using a markdown file in your github repo explaining the proof.




## 4. Load the data from the class hardware survey into memory using pandas, manipulate that data into a binnable form, and make exploratory histographs of the features of the dataset. For the features you couldn't address with a histogram provide a qualitative description.  Store your data in your github repo.
