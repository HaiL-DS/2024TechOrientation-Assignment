## Problem 1. 
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. <br>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```python
sum = 0
for i in range(1000):
    if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0:
        sum += i
    i +=1

sum
```
**The result is:** &nbsp;&nbsp; `233168`


## Problem 2. 
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

```python
Fibo = [1, 2]
sum = 0
while Fibo[-1] <= 4000000:
    Fibo.append(Fibo[-1]+Fibo[-2])

for i in Fibo[:-1]:
    if i%2 == 0:
        sum += i
sum
```
**The result is:** &nbsp;&nbsp; `4613732`


## Problem 3. 
<p>The prime factors of $13195$ are $5, 7, 13$ and $29$.</p>
<p>What is the largest prime factor of the number $600851475143$?</p>

```python
import math
def IsPrime(x):
    for i in range(2, x):
        if x%i == 0:
            return False
            break
    return True

def MaxPrimFact(x):
    for i in range(int(math.sqrt(x))+1, 1, -1):
        if x%i == 0 and IsPrime(i):
            print(i)
            break

MaxPrimFact(600851475143)
```
**The result is:** &nbsp;&nbsp; `6857`
